# Technologies

❓ Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Based on the powerful code editor and developer tools from [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) , Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps

❓ Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies.

❓ SQLite is a freely available open source database provided in Android. SQLite is a lightweight and compact database that does not require any kind of server to run. It is easily integrated into any kind of mobile application.

## Tools

- **Git**
    
    > Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
    > 

- **GitHub**
    
    > GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration

## Best Practices

<aside>
📌 During the building of this application we used some best practices of **DESIGN PATTERNS** like Singleton and others.

- **`Singleton`**: ***Singleton*** is a creational ***design pattern*** that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- **`Uses cases`** : We had used the **`Singleton`** with Database, where we’ve instantiated just once in the **DatabaseHelper** class and use it then in each of **ActivityMain** and **HistoriqueActivity** classes.
